# Solving for Value - Public Resources

Welcome to the official repository for **Solving for Value**! We wanted to create an easily accessible location for all of the resources we reference throughout the book, or those that we created as part of the process - we hope that you find a good use for them.

## MURAL Resources

We have made our work available in the form of MURAL templates which you are able to use yourselves and edit for your own situations. To use them yourself, simply create a free Mural account and click 'New Mural from template'.

### Templates

#### Product Wall

_The Product Wall template is designed to help teams visualize, organize, and prioritize product features, requirements, and tasks. It provides a collaborative space where all stakeholders can contribute and track progress in real-time._

1. Populate the Wall - Begin by adding key product elements that are relevant to you. You can see the ones we've used for Magnum Opus, but the boxes/sections aren't fixed. You are able to swap out different pieces to maximize transparency.
2. Collaborate in Real-Time - Use the template to facilitate discussions among team members. Everyone can contribute their thoughts, add comments, or adjust priorities, ensuring a dynamic and inclusive workflow. Maybe it could live on a 'team home page' or similar?

By leveraging this Product Wall template, youâ€™ll enhance collaboration, transparency, and efficiency throughout the product lifecycle.

#### Product Backlog Visualizations

_This template contains a selection of mini-models to help visualize Product Backlog Item contribution._

1. Experiment Loop - this 4-box model enforces empirical logic into your process of PBI planning. By following the clockwise arrows, you will define your experiment (a bet) and evaluate it, allowing you to determine the next best step.
2. Sprint Goal - the three columns are simple and not supposed to take a long time. Often, people struggle with crafting Sprint Goals with purpose and precision, so we've provided three prompt questions to help.
3/4. Work Item Mapping - map your PBIs into this model to determine dependencies, size and risk. It's a simple way to plan (at a mid-term horizon) without creating an over-complicated roadmap.

#### Story Mining

_Do you consider alternatives when deciding on a customer outcome? Story mining is a structured process that takes a job-driven (i.e. triggered in a specific scenario) approach to ideation in refinement._

1. Decide your Target - What or who are you aiming at? Place their image in the centre.
2. Scenario - What situation has triggered a need for change for this target?
3. Exploration Possibilities - What possible ideas do you have that could create this outcome/impact this scenario positively? There should be multiple options here that range risk, size, quality and effort.
4. Insights - What insights do you expect to see for these possibilities if you implemented them? This is where you consider validation opportunities.
5. Story - What is the user-led story that could find a place in your Product Backlog?

#### Stakeholder Management Strategy

_This template is a variation on a typical persona based model. To build effective communications strategies, we need to accept that not all stakeholders are equal (or even want the same things)._

1. Identify your Stakeholders - Whether they are latents, defenders, promoters or audience members, map out your stakeholders as specifically as you can.
2. What do they want? - You don't need to guess, just ask them. What motivates them? How do they like to receive information? Who can influence their thoughts and behaviours?
3. Plan your strategies, whether they are product-value-based, communications-based, risk-based or any other need, use the grid to influence your tactical and strategic decisions.
